## Tools to use
If you are not too familiar or confident to use Python to do the excercises provided, please feel free to use other tools! Here are some suggestions

### Statistical analysis
*Excel*\
Excel can be very useful for simple data analysis if you are already familiar with some basic operations of the software. There are many default visualisations and simple descriptive statistics that you can use and modify. If you want to do statistical analysis, please make sure to enable the [Analysis ToolPak](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-analysis-toolpak-in-excel-6a63e598-cd6d-42e3-9317-6b40ba1a66b4). You can use Analysis ToolPak for ANOVA, correlation, F-test, t-tests, regression and more.

*JASP*\
JASP is an open-source, free statistical software developed with JavaScript and C++ by a group of researchers at University of Amsterdam, Utrecht University, KU Leuven, Nyenrode Business University and University of Bern. The user interface is very easy to use and it allows for more advanced statistical analyses such as meta analysis, mixed models, SEM and mediation analysis, as well as Bayesian models. One may consider it a free version of IBM SPSS (and in fact more user-friendly). You may download JASP [here](https://jasp-stats.org/).

*JAMOVI*\
JAMOVI is another open-source, free software developed by software engineers coming from research institutes and various software development companies. The software offers a wide range of tests that most people need. You may download JAMOVI [here](https://www.jamovi.org/).

### Text analysis
*Voyant Tools*\
Voyant Tools is an open-source, web app for text and corpus analysis developed by researchers from McGill university and University of Alberta in Canada. Voyant Tools is one of the most popular tools out there in the market for non-programmers to perform text analysis as well as relevant visualisations, including Word Cloud and frequency plots. You can access voyant directly from [here](https://voyant-tools.org/).

*NLP Tools for the social sciences*\
A set of tools that allow for simple and complex linguistics analysis. Different tools offer distinct types of analyses, for example [TAASSC](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taassc.html) is designed for measuring syntactic complexity(e.g., mean length) and [TAACO](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taaco.html) consists of 150 indices to measure, such as, TTR. You can find the full list of tools [here](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/tools.html).

### Visualisations
*DataWrapper*\
A tool that perhaps needs no introduction, Datawrapper is one of the most recognised free infoviz software out there used by Reuters and The New York Times. The web-based datavis tool can help you create appealing graphs such as scatter plot, pie chart, symbol map and many more. More importantly, these visualisations are responsive and interactive. You can start creating graphs [here](https://app.datawrapper.de/chart/hizX0/upload).

### A tip of using the tools
Please make sure that you are importing the correct file types (e.g., CSV, plain text, etc.) and you have all the necessary data before you do any sort of analysis and visualisation (e.g., you need coordinates to create maps!).
